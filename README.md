# Garner_etal_2025_Fluidity_Sorting

This MATLAB code was written by Rikki M. Garner as a companion to the paper "Tissue Fluidity: A Double-Edged Sword for Multicellular Patterning", available online at: https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.01.640992

NOTE: This code requires MATLAB with the 'Statistics and Machine Learning', 'Curve Fitting', 'Image Processing', and 'Deep Learning' toolboxes installed.

Overview: The code is distributed into a series of folders (1) \SortingAnalysis\, which contains functions used to calculate the domain size growth for both the experimental data and the simulations. (2) \NeighborAnalysis\, which contains functions used to analyze the neighbor exchange rate in the simulations. (3) \Figure_Panels_Code\, which can be used to re-gnerate the figures from the data. And (4) \Generally_Useful\, which contains extra packages I did not write but are used to generate figures.

To download the code directly from the Github repository webpage, click the download button (down arrow icon next to the blue "Clone" button). Unzip the file, and place the above four folders into a directory Garner_etal_2025_Fluidity_Sorting\Code\. Alternatively, you can use git command line tools. First, install the git command line tools: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git. Next, open the command prompt and navigate the folder you'd like to download the code. Then type git clone https://github.com/megasonlab/Garner_etal_2025_Fluidity_Sorting.git Garner_etal_2025_Fluidity_Sorting

To run the code, start by opening MATLAB and adding the the Garner_etal_2025_Fluidity_Sorting folder and subfolders to your MATLAB path. Make sure this is the only folder on your path. To run a MATLAB file, you will need to rename any filepath variables with the full path to the location where the code and data are stored on your personal computer.

Unzip all of the data files in place. Due to long filenames, you may need to install 7-zip (https://www.7-zip.org/) to unzip this folder.

See the Word doc file "Garner et al 2025 Decription of Data and Code" for a more detailed description of each dataset and MATLAB file.
